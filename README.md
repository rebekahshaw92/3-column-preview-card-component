### Built with

- HTML 5 markup
- CSS
- Sass
- Bootstrap 5

### What I learned

While undertaking this challenge I learned a lot about working with Bootstrap's grids and cards. I was also able to work with Bootstrap's colums in order to allow me to place three cards side by side. This became handy when creating the mobile CSS as a lot of Bootstrap's elements are mobile fiendly and do not need a lot of CSS added. 

### Continued development

  I would like to continue to work with Bootstrap and learn about all the things it has to offer. 

  Possibly in the future I might udertake this challenge again without Bootstrap to develope my skills without Bootstrap.

  ### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - This site helped me to learn all I need to know about Bootstrap.
